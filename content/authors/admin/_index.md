I am a third year PhD student in the University of Michigan's electrical engineering and computer science department. My research focus is currently on stochastic computing - an emerging paradigm of computation that leverages probabilistic bitstreams to perform computation. Specifically, I work on hardware design problems related to stochastic computing at the logic level.
